    "prompt": "What is machine learning?",
    "response": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make decisions or predictions based on those patterns. Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems."

    "prompt": "Explain photosynthesis",
    "response": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). This process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll captures light energy. The overall equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2."

  {
    "prompt": "What are the main programming languages?",
    "response": "The main programming languages include: 1) Python - popular for data science, AI, and web development. 2) JavaScript - essential for web development and increasingly used for backend. 3) Java - widely used for enterprise applications and Android development. 4) C++ - used for system programming and performance-critical applications. 5) C# - popular for Windows applications and game development. 6) Go - growing in popularity for cloud and backend services. 7) Rust - gaining traction for systems programming with memory safety."

  {
    "prompt": "How does the internet work?",
    "response": "The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols. When you request a webpage, your device sends data packets through your ISP to routers across the network until they reach the destination server. The server then sends the requested data back through the network to your device. Key protocols include TCP/IP for reliable data transmission, HTTP/HTTPS for web communication, and DNS for translating domain names to IP addresses."
